            My Message for You
        </h1>
        <p>
            Who's fast-forwarding the time? Nganong ka paspas ra ba. 
            Despite everything that seems to be happening so fast, 
            I can't believe naka abot ta'g 3 months hahaha! 
            I'm not really fond of messages, pero murag daghan jud 
            ko'g long messages lately ayy HAHAHA

            <br>
            <br>

            I'm sorry for all the drama so far. I just love being 
            dramatic with you because I like seeing your reaction. I love
            your advices and your voice. I especially love your laugh.
            Why do you have a cute laugh? Ngano ako kay dili man? 
            Where's the justice!? HAHAHA 

            <br>
            <br>

            I still overthink, and I know that you know that. I wonder
            if I'll ever lose this habit? Hahaha. I hope that you'll 
            continue understanding this side of me everytime this happens.
            I'm sorry for wanting to change you before. I know I don't 
            have the right to do that. I'm sorry if I was being too rude
            last time.

            <br>
            <br>

            Anyways, thank you so much for being understanding, like, <i>all the time</i>. 
            Thank you for being so supportive. I don't know how I could return
            all the good things you do. Is it okay for me to get used to 
            all of these? Basin ug ma anad na nuon ko, mukalit ra'g ka
            wala tanan hahaha I DON'T want that to happen.

            <br>
            <br>

            If the time comes where tapulan na ko mag message, or dili 
            ko ka message, or unsa ba, I hope you still feel that my 
            feelings for you are real.

            <br>
            <br>

            You are, in no doubt, a part of my plans and prayers. I hope 
            these plans and dreams aren't just that. I hope they come true.
            Happy third monthsary! I wab youuu! Still not letting you go hahaha!
