            Pahabol na lang ni. I didn't think nga ma ok pa ta after what I said.
            I can't believe I just embarrased myself to you. I got too angry, and
            I know that it was my fault. Thank you for setting things back to the
            way it should be. 

            <br><br>

            One thing that I learned from my part-time job is that when the students
            are losing faith in themselves on whether or not they could finish the 
            program, we as peer mentors, should help them find their "why."

            <br><br>

            You might wonder how relevant this is to our situation, but I must tell 
            you that this must have been what happened to me. When you asked me if 
            I really loved you, I couldn't bring myself to say yes even if I wanted to.

            <br><br>

            But you helped me find my "why." When you asked me what I liked about you,
            I was reminded why I had chosen you in the first place, and why I had stayed
            even after all those not so good events. 

            <br><br>

            Please don't give up on me. If this happens again, please help me find my
            "why" again. Just like what I have told you, I want my first to be my last.
            I'm really sorry if I'm such a pain in the ass. Thank you for being patient
            with me. 
            
            <br>
            <br>

            Your pala away na person,
            <br>
