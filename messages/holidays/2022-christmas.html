            Merry Christmas
        </h1>
        <p>
            My wish for this Christmas is to get to know you better. I wish that 
            you'll find happiness and joy from the people around you. Please 
            continue to be kind.

            <br>
            <br>
            I wish I could give you my gift in person. But for now, I'll just keep 
            it and give it to you when the time is right. It's not much, just a
            small keepsake from me hahaha 

            <br><br>
            Anyways, I won't be writing too long since it's late and tomorrow is Sunday.
            I made this in advance so that I won't forget. I love you po, I hope 
            you'll have a very merry Christmas.
            
            <br>
            <br>

            From the very boring person in your life,
            <br>
